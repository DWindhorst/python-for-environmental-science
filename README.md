# Python for Environmental Science
Repo for the Jupyter notebooks and code for a programming course at the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen. This course is meant to get students from not knowing how to program at all, to being able to use the pandas library to work with data and make good figures with matplotlib. I try to get the topics across in a universal way, so the skills teached are not restricted to environmental science. The title is meant to refer that this course covers things that are useful when working in environmental science and is less about environmental science itself.  

If you want to contribute I'd be happy to hear from you. If any questions arise please contact [me](https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb09/institute/ilr/wasser/mitarbeiter/copy_of_houska).

This course is based on Jupyter Notebooks, if you do not know how to use them take a look [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).
