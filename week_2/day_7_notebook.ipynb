    "This day is meant to cover the usage of matplotlib (and to some extension seaborn), but first I would like to get a concept across that will help you to make nicer plots. The [data-ink ratio](https://youtu.be/JIMUzJzqaA8). This concept helps you to focus your graphics on the most essential parts. The following two bar charts represent the most extreme examples for a very high and a very low data to ink ratio.\n",
